# tobybot11's nvim configuration setup

## first attempt

I follwed [How I Setup Neovim On My Mac To Make It Amazing - Complete Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdn_pKJUda8&t=256s) and
[Josean's Github](https://github.com/josean-dev/dev-environment-files) to create the first attempt at a full on neovim setup.
This helped me to understand lua and neovim much better but I wasn't happy with the directory structure and the amount of work each plugin required for just default setup.
